# Backup

## What is backup ?

I create this project to help people copy files in a backup system with several options. I'm also currently working on a versioning system. The goal is also to improve my knowledge of python.

I'm using **wxPython** for the GUI. This can be easly install with pip : https://wxpython.org/pages/downloads/index.html.

## How to run the app ?

The app can be tested with this command :

```sh
python3 App.py
```

## How to use it ?

* The main page is build to directly copy files in a backup system.
* The other page is to copy files and compare them with another instance. You can then choose to replace somme files which are changed or keep them.
